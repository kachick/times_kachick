# times_kachick

The background is written in [#1](https://github.com/kachick/times_kachick/issues/1)
In short, this repository might cover timeline/notes/website/blog for [@kachick](https://github.com/kachick).

- I basically write articles in Japanese(日本語), so might be unhelpful to English users.
- When sending messages to kachick, Japanese and English are also okay. (I will use DeepL for English message!)
